### <div align="center"> 👋 Hey there! I'm Stefan Mostovych
- <div align="right">I'm a data science & quantitative finance enthusiast with a strong background in Python, R, and statistical modeling. I graduated from the University of Florida with a Master of Science in Information Systems & Operations Management, specializing in Data Science.

- During my studies, I focused extensively on regression analysis, building simple and multiple regression models to extract insights from data. One of my biggest takeaways from the program was learning how to leverage statistics for decision-making—a skill I continue to apply in my work.>

🚀 Quant & Algorithmic Trading
- I was also a leader in AlgoGators, a student-run quantitative trading fund where we developed futures trading algorithms. This experience fueled my passion for algorithmic trading, financial modeling, and data-driven strategies.

🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Ironman Athlete
- Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me training for my next Ironman! Competing in endurance sports has taught me discipline, resilience, and the power of continuous improvement. Right now, I’m preparing for my second Ironman 70.3.

🔎 What I’m Working On

- Exploring machine learning in finance 📈
- Developing trading strategies & backtesting models 🤖
- Experimenting with quantitative research & time series analysis ⏳
💡 Always eager to collaborate, learn, and build. Let’s connect and talk data, trading, or endurance sports!
