# Hey, I'm Stefan Mostovych

Full-stack developer and data scientist based in Jacksonville, FL. I build web applications, trading algorithms, and data-driven models.

I graduated from the **University of Florida** with an MS in Information Systems & Operations Management, specializing in Data Science. During my time at UF, I led **AlgoGators**, a student-run quantitative trading fund where we developed futures trading algorithms. I also co-founded **ChartLab**, a trading platform built from the ground up to study and analyze chart patterns.

## What I Work On

**Full-Stack Development** — Building web applications and SaaS products with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL

**AI & Machine Learning** — Applying ML and AI to solve real-world problems across finance, sports, and business

**Algorithmic Trading** — Developing and backtesting systematic trading strategies for futures and crypto markets

## Beyond Code
